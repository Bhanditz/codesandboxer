## We need more tests!

1. More tests, make sure there is better file coverage
2. Add a `preLoad` prop, for people who want to load ahead of time
3. Render prop for children passes back loading and error options
4. Be super careful to catch all errors
5. Rewrite readme to focus on use-cases and explaining how to implement them.
