## We need more tests!

[x] Handle fetching js paths that could be a file or a directory, rather than assuming everything is a file
[ ] More tests, make sure there is better file coverage
[x] Add a `preload` prop, for people who want to load ahead of time
[x] Render prop for children passes back loading and error options
[ ] Be super careful to catch all errors
[ ] Rewrite readme to focus on use-cases and explaining how to implement them.
