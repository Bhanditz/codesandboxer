## Things I am working on

[ ] More tests, make sure there is better file coverage
[ ] Be super careful to catch all errors
[ ] Rewrite readme to focus on use-cases and explaining how to implement them.
[x] Set default sandbox page to be the `example.js` file.
[x] Explore other API options learned about from embed docs - nothing else seems important to implement now.
[x] Explore removing this being a form and form-submission, getting data back instead - still not possible. Wrapped my examples up so I can get help with it.
[ ] For replacements and file fetching, support `requires` as well as `imports`
[ ] pull all of the logic around navigating filePaths into its own Package
[ ] pull the logic around fetching and then deploying files to CSB into its own Package
[ ] Look into supporting non-`create-react-app` uploads (Having to parse non-js files will need to be a part of this)
